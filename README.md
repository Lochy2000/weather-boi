## How It Works

Let me walk you through how the different pieces of this application work together.

### The Big Picture

When you first load the app, it presents you with a search bar. Type in a city name, and as you type, it queries the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to suggest matching locations. Select one (or click "Use My Location"), and the app fetches comprehensive weather data for that spot.

The weather data gets cached for 5 minutes using React Query, so if you switch between locations and come back, you won't waste API calls or wait for loading. Your recent searches and unit preferences are stored in your browser's localStorage, so they persist between visits.

### Component Architecture

The app is organized into focused, reusable components:

#### Layout Components
- **Header** - Houses the app logo and unit conversion dropdown
- **Layout** - Main wrapper that provides consistent spacing and structure
- **InstallPWA** - Toast notification that appears after 10 seconds, offering PWA installation
- **InstallBanner** - Fixed bottom banner with install button (dismissible)

#### Weather Components
- **WeatherDashboard** - The main container orchestrating all weather displays
- **CurrentWeatherCard** - Shows the big temperature number, condition icon, and location
- **WeatherMetrics** - Grid displaying feels-like temp, humidity, wind, and precipitation
- **ExtendedMetrics** - Collapsible section with UV index, visibility, pressure, gusts, and clouds
- **DailyForecast** - 7 cards showing daily forecasts with highs, lows, and icons
- **HourlyForecast** - Interactive chart showing temperature progression over 24 hours
- **SunriseSunset** - Displays sunrise and sunset times with visual indicators
- **SearchSection** - The search input with autocomplete and geolocation button

#### UI Primitives
Reusable building blocks like `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Skeleton`, and `Toast` that maintain consistent styling across the app.

### State Management Strategy

The app uses two complementary state management approaches:

#### Client State (Zustand)
Handles everything that lives in your browser:
- **User Preferences** - Selected units for temperature, wind, and precipitation
- **Location Data** - Currently selected location and recent search history (max 5)
- **UI State** - Which day is selected, loading transitions

This state persists to localStorage, so your preferences survive page refreshes.

#### Server State (React Query)
Manages data fetched from APIs:
- **Weather Data** - Current conditions, hourly, and daily forecasts
- **Location Searches** - Geocoding results

React Query provides automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates. It's smart enough to know when data is stale and needs refreshing.

### API Integration

The app talks to two Open-Meteo endpoints:

**Geocoding API** (`https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`)
- Takes a city name query
- Returns matching locations with coordinates, country, and timezone info

**Weather Forecast API** (`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`)
- Takes latitude/longitude coordinates
- Returns current weather, hourly forecasts (48 hours), and daily forecasts (7 days)
- Automatically handles unit conversions based on your preferences

All API calls go through centralized service functions in `lib/api/services/`, which handle error transformation and provide consistent interfaces.

### Data Flow

Here's what happens when you search for a city:

1. You type into the search input (debounced by 300ms to avoid hammering the API)
2. Geocoding service fetches matching locations
3. You select a location from the dropdown
4. Location gets saved to Zustand store and added to recent searches
5. React Query detects the location change and triggers a weather data fetch
6. Weather service fetches forecast data, which gets cached by React Query
7. All weather components react to the new data and update their displays
8. If you select a different day in the forecast, all metrics update to show that day's data

### Performance Optimizations

**Caching**
- Weather data cached for 5 minutes (reduces redundant API calls)
- Recent locations persist in localStorage
- Service worker caches app shell for offline access

**Debouncing**
- Search input debounced by 300ms to prevent excessive API requests while typing

**Code Optimization**
- Tree-shaking with ES modules eliminates unused code
- Tailwind CSS purges unused styles in production
- Vite's fast refresh keeps development smooth

**Rendering**
- Skeleton screens show immediately during loading (perceived performance)
- Minimal re-renders through precise state updates
- SVG icons for crisp display at any size

## PWA Features

This app is a full Progressive Web App, which means:

### Installation
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)** - Click the install icon in the address bar, or use the in-app install prompt
- **Android** - Tap "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu, or use the in-app banner/toast
- **iOS Safari** - Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen" (manual installation)

### Install Prompts
The app includes two ways to install:
1. **Toast Notification** - Appears after 10 seconds in the bottom-right corner
2. **Bottom Banner** - Fixed banner at the bottom of the page (can be dismissed)

Both prompts only appear when the app is installable and not already installed.

### Offline Support
The service worker caches the app shell and key resources, so basic functionality works even without internet. Weather data requires a connection, but the UI remains accessible.

### Manifest Configuration
- **Name**: Weather Now
- **Display**: Standalone (no browser UI)
- **Theme Color**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Icons**: Multiple sizes for different devices

## Browser Support

| Browser | Versions | PWA Install |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Chrome | Last 2 versions | Yes (desktop & Android) |
| Edge | Last 2 versions | Yes (desktop & Android) |
| Firefox | Last 2 versions | No install prompt |
| Safari | Last 2 versions | Manual (iOS) |

PWA installation prompts work best on Chrome and Edge (Android and desktop). iOS users can manually add to home screen via Safari's share menu.
