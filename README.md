## Key Components

### Weather Dashboard
The main dashboard displays all weather information in a responsive grid layout:
- Current weather card with live temperature
- Weather metrics grid (feels like, humidity, wind, precipitation)
- 7-day forecast cards
- Hourly temperature timeline

### Search System
- Debounced search input for performance
- Autocomplete suggestions from Open-Meteo geocoding API
- Keyboard navigation support
- Recent searches stored in localStorage

### State Management
- **Zustand Store** manages:
  - User preferences (units)
  - Current location
  - Recent locations
  - UI state (selected day, transitions)
- **React Query** handles:
  - API data fetching
  - Caching strategies
  - Loading and error states

## API Integration

### Open-Meteo Endpoints Used
1. **Geocoding API** - Location search and autocomplete
   - Endpoint: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`

2. **Weather Forecast API** - Weather data
   - Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`
   - Current weather variables
   - Hourly forecast data
   - Daily forecast data

### Data Caching
- React Query implements smart caching
- Weather data cached for 5 minutes
- Location searches cached for session

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 375px and up
- **Tablet**: 768px and up
- **Desktop**: 1440px and up

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly interface
- Collapsible sections
- Optimized font sizes
- Horizontal scrolling for forecast cards

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of components
- **Debounced Search**: Reduces API calls
- **Data Caching**: Minimizes redundant requests
- **Optimized Images**: Weather icons as inline SVGs
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind CSS purging unused styles

## Browser Support

- Chrome (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Edge (last 2 versions)

## Known Issues

- No test coverage yet implemented
- Accessibility could be enhanced (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- TypeScript strict mode could be enhanced

## Completed Enhancements (Stage 2)

- âœ… Geolocation detection for automatic current location
- âœ… Extended weather metrics (UV index, visibility, air pressure, wind gusts, cloud cover)
- âœ… Dynamic day-aware metrics (metrics update per selected day)
- âœ… Collapsible extended metrics section

## Planned Future Enhancements

- Sunrise/sunset times with visual indicators
- Favorites/saved locations system
- Compare weather between multiple locations
- Dark/light mode themes
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
