<img width="200" height="200" alt="Weather App Logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cf35258-ab87-45de-bdbb-28d230cfcbaf" />

## Overview

A modern, responsive weather application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This app provides real-time weather information using the Open-Meteo API, featuring current conditions, 7-day forecasts, and hourly temperature data with a beautiful, intuitive interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Location Search**: Smart search with autocomplete suggestions for cities worldwide
- **Current Weather**: Real-time temperature, weather conditions, and location details
- **Weather Metrics**: Comprehensive data including:
  - "Feels like" temperature
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Precipitation amounts
- **7-Day Forecast**: Daily high/low temperatures with weather icons
- **Hourly Forecast**: 24-hour temperature timeline with day selector
- **Unit Conversion**: Toggle between Imperial and Metric units
  - Temperature: Celsius/Fahrenheit
  - Wind Speed: km/h, mph
  - Precipitation: mm, inches
- **Recent Searches**: Quick access to previously searched locations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## Key Components

### Weather Dashboard
The main dashboard displays all weather information in a responsive grid layout:
- Current weather card with live temperature
- Weather metrics grid (feels like, humidity, wind, precipitation)
- 7-day forecast cards
- Hourly temperature timeline

### Search System
- Debounced search input for performance
- Autocomplete suggestions from Open-Meteo geocoding API
- Keyboard navigation support
- Recent searches stored in localStorage

### State Management
- **Zustand Store** manages:
  - User preferences (units)
  - Current location
  - Recent locations
  - UI state (selected day, transitions)
- **React Query** handles:
  - API data fetching
  - Caching strategies
  - Loading and error states

## API Integration

### Open-Meteo Endpoints Used
1. **Geocoding API** - Location search and autocomplete
   - Endpoint: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`

2. **Weather Forecast API** - Weather data
   - Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`
   - Current weather variables
   - Hourly forecast data
   - Daily forecast data

### Data Caching
- React Query implements smart caching
- Weather data cached for 5 minutes
- Location searches cached for session

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 375px and up
- **Tablet**: 768px and up
- **Desktop**: 1440px and up

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly interface
- Collapsible sections
- Optimized font sizes
- Horizontal scrolling for forecast cards

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of components
- **Debounced Search**: Reduces API calls
- **Data Caching**: Minimizes redundant requests
- **Optimized Images**: Weather icons as inline SVGs
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind CSS purging unused styles

## Browser Support

- Chrome (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Edge (last 2 versions)

## Known Issues
